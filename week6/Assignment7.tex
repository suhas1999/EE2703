    \section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In this assignment, we deal with Linear Time Invariant systems and their
responses to certain inputs. We use the scipy.signal module to perform
analysis of systems with rational polynomial transfer functions. We look
at a coupled system of differential equations, and also a linear
electrical circuit which behaves like a low-pass filter.

	

	

	

	

	
		
    \section{Question 1}\label{question-1}

We solve for the response by using the property that the Laplace
transform of the output \(X(s)\) of a system with transfer function
\(H(s)\) to an input with Laplace transform \(F(s)\) is given by:

\[X(s) = H(s) F(s)\]

We then use the sp.impulse function to find the inverse Laplace
transform of the output over a certain range of times:

    t2,y,svec=sp.lsim(H,f,t)
    return y
    
t_start = 0
t_end = 100

    We plot the output for an input with a decay constant of \(0.5\):

	

	

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{Figure_1.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
	
		
    We observe that the output of the system in steady state is a a sinusoid
with the same frequency as the input, but with no decay. This is because
the natural frequency of the system is equal to the frequency of the
input.

	

	
		
    \section{Question 2}\label{question-2}

We repeat the plot with a decay constant of \(0.05\):

	

	

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{Figure_1-1.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
	
		
    We observe that the steady state response follows the same trend as the
previous case, except that it has a much larger amplitude. This is
because the input excited the system for a longer duration due to its
smaller decay constant. This resulted in a larger buildup of output due
to resonance. We can see that, during the buildup of the output, the
amplitude grows linearly. This is characteristic of resonance in a
second order system. This will be made clear by exciting the system with
slightly different frequencies:

	

	
		
    \section{Problem 3}\label{problem-3}

We find the response to inputs with slightly different frequencies
around \(1.5\).

We observe that an input with frequency of exactly \(1.5\) reaches the
largest steady state amplitude. This is because of the aforementioned
resonance. Nearby frequencies are not tuned to the natural response of
the system, so their amplitudes die down after the initial rise before
reaching a steady state. This can also be understood by looking at the
magnitude of the transfer function at these frequencies. Let us find the
Bode plots of this transfer function:
	

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{Figure_1-3.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}

    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{phase.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
	
		
    From the above Bode plots, it is clear that this system is a second
order system with complex conjugate poles. The quality factor of this
system is actually infinte, but is not visible in the graph of the
magnitude due to lack of resolution. It is much more evident in the
phase plot, in which it drops from 0 degrees to -180 degrees like a
step, which is indicative of infinite Q. This infinte quality means that
the magnitude decays sharply around the resonant frequency of \(1.5\).
This is why we observe a much lesser amplitude in output for frequencies
which are slightly detuned from the resonant frequency.

	

	
		
    \section{Question 4}\label{question-4}

There are two ways to approach a set of coupled differential equations.
One way is to solve them by eliminating one equation by substitution.
Let us first use this approach. The given equations are:

\[\ddot{x} + x -y = 0\] \[\ddot{y} + 2(y -x) = 0\]

We substitute for \(y\) in the second equation using the first and
obtain the following:

\[x^{(4)} + 3x^{(2)} = 0\]

where the superscript in parenthesis denotes the order of the
derivative.

We also need to solve for the initial conditions. We obtain the
following set of initial conditions on only derivatives of \(x\):

\[x(0) = 1\] \[x^{(1)}(0) = 0\] \[x^{(2)}(0) = -1\] \[x^{(3)}(0) = 0\]

Using these conditions, we take the Laplace transform of the above
equation and solve for \(X(s)\) to get:

\[X(s) = \frac{s^2+2}{s^3+3s}\]

Substituting back, we find for \(Y(s)\):

\[Y(s) = \frac{2}{s^3+3s}\]

We can now invert these Laplace transforms to find the solutions in the
time domain.

xs = sp.lti([1,0,2],[1,0,3,0])
ys = sp.lti([2],[1,0,3,0])

t = np.linspace(0,20,200)

t1,x = sp.impulse(xs,None,t)
t2,y = sp.impulse(ys,None,t)

plt.plot(t1,x,label=r"x(t)")
plt.plot(t2,y,label=r"y(t)")

The solutions are plotted below:

    \begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We observe that the solutions are sinusoidal with a certain DC offset.
\item
  This is evident from the expressions of the Laplace Transforms of the
  solutions as the denominator contains a factor of \(s\).
\item
  We observe that these two DC offsets are the same for both \(x\) and
  \(y\).
\item
  This can be confirmed by noticing that the differential equation in
  \(u = x-y\) has no forcing function, so the DC offset of \(u\) must be
  \(0\). Therefore, \(x\) and \(y\) must have the same DC offset.
\item
  They also oscillate with the same frequencies because the coefficient
  of the second derivative term is the same in both differential
  equations.
\item
  This system of equations models two masses attached to the two ends of
  an ideal spring with no damping. \(x\) and \(y\) are the positions of
  the masses in a reference frame moving at the same speed as the centre
  of mass, but offset from the centre of mass by some amount.
\end{itemize}

	

	
		
    \section{Problem 5}\label{problem-5}

We find the transfer function by finding the natural frequency and the
damping constant of the circuit.

    We plot the magnitude and phase of the transfer function on log plots:

    \begin{itemize}
\item
  It is clear that there are two poles, one at around \(10^4\) rad/s and
  another at around \(10^8\) rad/s.
\item
  Since the poles are not coincident, this means that the system is
  overdamped, with a quality factor \(<1\). The quality factor can be
  estimated using \[Q = \frac{\omega_{p1}}{\omega_n}\] where
  \(\omega_{p1}\) is the first pole. We get \(Q \approx 0.01\)
\item
  Since the system has no zeros, it acts as an all-pole low pass filter.
\item
  Since the two poles are quite far apart, we can approximate the 3-dB
  bandwidth of the filter to be at the first pole, i.e., \(10^4\) rad/s.
\item
  We therefore expect the system to pass frequencies lower than \(10^4\)
  rad/s and attenuate higher frequencies. We see this effect in the next
  part.
\end{itemize}

	

	
		
    \section{Question 6}\label{question-6}

We excite the system in Question 5 with two sinusoids, one whose
frequency is below the 3-dB bandwith and one whose frequency is higher.

    We plot the time domain response in two parts, one for the first 30
\(\mu s\), to observe transient effects, and one for \(10\) msec, to
observe the steady state response.

    \section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The transient response of the system is rapidly increasing. This is
  because the system has to charge up to match the input amplitude. This
  results in a phase difference between the input and the output. This
  can also be interpreted as a delay between the input and the output
  signals.
\item
  The response can be broken up into a low frequency component and a
  high frequency one, after the transient effect has died down.
\item
  The high frequency component is extremely attenuated (by -40 dB
  infact), so in the 10 msec plot, it is almost not visible.
\item
  The low frequency component passes through almost unaffected with an
  amplitude of slightly less than 1. This is because its frequency is
  below the 3-dB bandwidth of the system.
\item
  Thus, it is clear that the system behaves like a low-pass filter.
\end{itemize}
